# About the project

Rmd makes it possible to use a YAML header to specify certain parameters
right at the beginning of the document. Built-in YAML parameters make it
easier to create more organized and informative reports. However, there
are few tutorials or summarized articles to display all the settings and
parameters for `YAML metadata` in R Markdown. This readme file give you
clear and enough materials for that.
