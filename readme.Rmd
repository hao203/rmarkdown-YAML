# YAML metadata (header) in R Markdown

YAML is a human-readable and easy to write language to define data structures.

Rmd makes it possible to use a YAML header to specify certain parameters right at the beginning of the document. Built-in YAML parameters make it easier to create more organized and informative reports. However, there are few tutorials or summarized articles to display all the settings and parameters for `YAML metadata` in R Markdown. This readme file give you the power to easily control R Markdown by YAML.

# Terminology and norms

-   R lang -- use upper case letter `R`
-   Rmd -- capitalizes the first letter for `Rmd` files
-   R Markdown -- the R Markdown module or notebook of Rstudio 
-   rmarkdown -- the package of `rmarkdown`
-   YAML -- /ˈjæməl/ a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language"
-   YAML header/metadata -- the settings data written by YAML in Rmd header
-   All the YAML metadata are `lower case letters` except file paths or file names

# Basic

## Syntax

### Data Structure

Source: ymlthis package[@Barrett2021] vignette

A YAML code block should be fenced in with `---` before and after (you can also use ... to end the YAML block, but this is not very common in R Markdown).

1. Scalars, or variables, are defined using a colon and a **space**.A dictionary is represented in a simples `key: value` form (the colon must be followed by a `space`)
    
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "YAML metadata for R Markdown with examples"
    author: Hao Liang
    fontsize: 12pt
    ---
    ```
  
2. All members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a `'- '` (a dash and a space):

    ```yaml
    # A list of tasty fruits
    - Apple
    - Orange
    - Strawberry
    - Mango
    
    # OR
    [Apple, Orange, Strawberry, Mango]
    ```

3. More complicated data structures are possible, such as lists of dictionaries, dictionaries whose values are lists or a mix of both:

    ```yaml
    author: 
     - Name_1   # can be indented or not
     - Name_2   # but be consistent among different entries
    ```
  
4. Dictionaries and lists can also be represented in an abbreviated form if you really want to:

    ```yaml
    author: [Name_1, Name_2]
    ```

5. Strings can be denoted with a `|` character, which preserves newlines, or a `>` character, which folds newlines.

    ```yaml
    abstract: |
      One or two sentences providing a **basic introduction** to the field,  comprehensible     to a scientist in any discipline.
      
      Two to three sentences of **more detailed background**, comprehensible  to scientists     in related disciplines.
    
      
    abstract: >
      One or two sentences providing a **basic introduction** to the field,  comprehensible     to a scientist in any discipline.
      
      Two to three sentences of **more detailed background**, comprehensible  to scientists     in related disciplines.

    ```

6. Logical values in YAML are unusual: `true/false`, `yes/no`, and `on/off` are all equivalent to TRUE/FALSE in R. Any of these turn on the table of contents:

    ```yaml
    toc: true
    toc: yes
    toc: on
    ```

### Indent

In YAML, spaces(indent) are used to indicate nesting (`tab` is not recommended.). When we want to specify the output function `pdf_document(toc = TRUE)`, we need to nest it under the `output` field. We also need to nest `toc` under pdf_document so that it gets passed to that function correctly. 

```yaml
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    toc: true
---
```
In R, the equivalent structure is a nested list, each with a name: `list(output = list(pdf_document = list(toc = TRUE)))`. Similarly, you can call this in R Markdown using the metadata object, e.g. `metadata$output$pdf_document$toc`. The hierarchical structure (which you can see with `draw_yml_tree()`) looks like this:

```yaml
└── output:
    └── pdf_document:
        └── toc: true
```

Without the extra indents, YAML doesn’t know toc is connected to `pdf_document` and thinks the value of `pdf_document` is NULL. YAML that looks like this:

```yaml
output:
  pdf_document:
toc: true

├── output:
│   └── pdf_document: null
└── toc: true

```
Some YAML fields take unnamed vectors as their value. You can specify an element of the vector by adding a new line and - (note that the values can be indented or not below category here).

```yaml
category:
- R
- Reprodicible Research
```

### quote and R code

You may have noticed that strings in YAML don’t always need to be quoted. However, it can be useful to explicitly wrap strings in quotes when they contain special characters like : and @.

```yaml
title: 'R Markdown: An Introduction'
```

R code can be written as inline expressions `` `r knitr::inline_expr('expr')` ``.  `yml_code()` will capture R code for you and put it in a valid format. R code in `params` needs to be slightly different: use `!r `(e.g. `!r expr`) to call an R object.

```yaml
author: '`r whoami::fullname()`'
params:
  date: !r Sys.Date()
```

## Basic setting metadata

### Top-level basic settings

These settings are based on the original `rmarkdown` package without any other associated packages.

Set Top-level Basic R Markdown YAML Fields. e.g.

```yaml
---
title: "YAML metadata for R Markdown with examples"
subtitle: "YAML header"
author: Hao Liang
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  md_document:
    toc: yes
    toc_depth: 2
abstract: YAML is a human-readable and easy to write language to define data structures.
keywords: ["YAML", "Rmd"]
subject: Medicine
description: Rmd makes it possible to use a YAML header to specify certain parameters right at the beginning of the document.
category: 
 - Rmd
 - Medicine
lang: "en-US" 
---
```

This field is not available in all output formats. It is available in:

| field       | html_document | pdf_document | word_document | odt_document | powerpoint_presentation |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| subtitle    | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:      |              |                         |
| abstract    | :smiley:      | :smiley:     |               |              |                         |
| keywords    | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:                |
| subject     | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:                |

The document language using IETF language tags such as "en" or "en-US". The [language subtag lookup tool](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/) can help find the appropriate tag.

> Certain R Markdown templates will allow you to specify additional parameters directly within the YAML. For example, the Distill output format allows url, affiliation, and affiliation_url to be specified. After you install the distill package. You can see the corresponding section in this tutorial.

```yaml
---
title: "Distill for R Markdown"
author:
  - name: "JJ Allaire"
    url: https://github.com/jjallaire
    affiliation: RStudio
    affiliation_url: https://www.rstudio.com
output: distill::distill_article
---
```

### output

The `output` field of YAML is very important for R Markdown. The `rmarkdown` package contains a lot of output formats for different use.

Source: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html

```yaml
---
output: html_notebook
---

```

The `rmarkdown` package/ Rmd natively support the following formats:

  - html_notebook
  - html_document
  - pdf_document
  - word_document
  - odt_document
  - rtf_document
  - md_document
  - ioslides_presentation
  - beamer_presentation
  - powerpoint_presentation
  - html_vignette

If you use one output format without additional arguments, the value of output can simply be the name of the function.

```yaml
---
output: html_document
---
```

However, if you’re specifying more than one output type, you must use the nesting syntax. If you don’t want to include additional arguments, use "default" as the function’s value.

```yaml
---
output:
  html_document: default
  pdf_document: default
---
```

### toc

`toc` is the sub-level option of any output formats. You can add a table of contents (TOC) using the `toc` option and specify the depth of headers that it applies to using the `toc_depth` option[@Xie2018]. For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Habits"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
    toc_float: # invalid for other output formats of non-html
      collapsed: false
      smooth_scroll: false
---
```



# advanced options for html and pdf

R Markdown stands on the shoulders of `knitr` and Pandoc[@xie2020]. html and pdf are the most common formats outputted by R Markdown, most other formats are also transformed from them. From the figure below, we clearly see the difference for generating html and pdf. .md files can be directly converted to html, but md -> pdf is time-consuming and depends on tex. So the options for these two formats are not alwasys compatible.

## html

If code blocks in the output document are potentially distracting to readers, you may choose to fold/show them initially. Readers can then choose to display them by clicking the fold buttons:

```yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    code_folding: hide #choose to hide/show code blocks initially.
    number_sections: true # add section numbering to headers
    theme: united # Bootstrap theme (themes are drawn from the Bootswatch theme library)
    highlight: tango #specifies the syntax highlighting style
    css: styles.css # custom CSS ( set the theme and potentially highlight to null)
    fig_width: 7 # Figure options
    fig_height: 6
    fig_caption: true
    df_print: paged # tables are printed as HTML tables with support for pagination
    self_contained: false # keep dependencies in external files
    keep_md: true # keep a copy of the Markdown file
    includes:
      in_header: header.html # inject CSS and JavaScript code into the <head> tag
      before_body: doc_prefix.html # include a header that shows a banner or logo.
      after_body: doc_suffix.html # include a footer
    template: quarterly_report.html # custom templates
    md_extensions: -autolink_bare_uris+hard_line_breaks # preface an option with '-' to disable and '+' to enable itpreface an option with - to disable and + to enable it
---
```



## pdf

# style control

## html

## pdf

### header-includes:

# Bibliographies and Citations

https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html

# Chinese support

# params

# Pandoc arguments

# shared options

If you want to specify a set of default options to be shared by multiple documents within a directory, you can include a file named _output.yml within the directory. Note that no YAML delimiters (---) or the enclosing output field are used in this file. For example:

```yaml
html_document:
  self_contained: false
  theme: united
  highlight: textmate
```
