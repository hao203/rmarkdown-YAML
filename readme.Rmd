# YAML metadata (header) in R Markdown

YAML is a human-readable and easy to write language to define data structures.

Rmd makes it possible to use a YAML header to specify certain parameters right at the beginning of the document. Built-in YAML parameters make it easier to create more organized and informative reports. However, there are few tutorials or summarized articles to display all the settings and parameters for `YAML metadata` in R Markdown. This readme file give you the power to easily control R Markdown by YAML.

-   https://github.com/kamapu/yamlme --- This package aims to save documents with their respective settings (yaml-head) in R-objects. 

# Terminology and norms

-   R lang -- use upper case letter `R`
-   Rmd -- capitalize the first letter for `Rmd`
-   R Markdown -- the R Markdown module or notebook of Rstudio 
-   rmarkdown -- the package of `rmarkdown`
-   YAML -- /ˈjæməl/ a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language"
-   YAML header/metadata -- the settings data written by YAML in Rmd header
-   All the YAML metadata are `lower case letters` except arguments, file paths or file names

# Basic

## Syntax

### Data structure

> Source: ymlthis package[@Barrett2021] vignette

A YAML code block should be fenced in with `---` before and after (you can also use ... to end the YAML block, but this is not very common in R Markdown).

1. Scalars, or variables, are defined using a colon and a **space**.A dictionary is represented in a simples `key: value` form (the colon must be followed by a `space`)
    
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "YAML metadata for R Markdown with examples"
    author: Hao Liang
    fontsize: 12pt
    ---
    ```
  
2. All members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a `'- '` (a dash and a space):

    ```yaml
    # A list of tasty fruits
    - Apple
    - Orange
    - Strawberry
    - Mango
    
    # OR
    [Apple, Orange, Strawberry, Mango]
    ```

3. More complicated data structures are possible, such as lists of dictionaries, dictionaries whose values are lists or a mix of both:

    ```yaml
    author: 
     - Name_1   # can be indented or not
     - Name_2   # but be consistent among different entries
    ```
  
4. Dictionaries and lists can also be represented in an abbreviated form if you really want to:

    ```yaml
    author: [Name_1, Name_2]
    ```

5. Strings can be denoted with a `|` character, which preserves newlines, or a `>` character, which folds newlines.

    ```yaml
    abstract: |
      One or two sentences providing a **basic introduction** to the field,  comprehensible     to a scientist in any discipline.
      
      Two to three sentences of **more detailed background**, comprehensible  to scientists     in related disciplines.
    
      
    abstract: >
      One or two sentences providing a **basic introduction** to the field,  comprehensible     to a scientist in any discipline.
      
      Two to three sentences of **more detailed background**, comprehensible  to scientists     in related disciplines.

    ```

6. Logical values in YAML are unusual: `true/false`, `yes/no`, and `on/off` are all equivalent to TRUE/FALSE in R. Any of these turn on the table of contents:

    ```yaml
    toc: true
    toc: yes
    toc: on
    ```

### Indent

In YAML, spaces(indent) are used to indicate nesting (`tab` is not recommended.). When we want to specify the output function `pdf_document(toc = TRUE)`, we need to nest it under the `output` field. We also need to nest `toc` under pdf_document so that it gets passed to that function correctly. 

```yaml
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    toc: true
---
```
In R, the equivalent structure is a nested list, each with a name: `list(output = list(pdf_document = list(toc = TRUE)))`. Similarly, you can call this in R Markdown using the metadata object, e.g. `metadata$output$pdf_document$toc`. The hierarchical structure (which you can see with `draw_yml_tree()`) looks like this:

```yaml
└── output:
    └── pdf_document:
        └── toc: true
```

Without the extra indents, YAML doesn’t know toc is connected to `pdf_document` and thinks the value of `pdf_document` is NULL. YAML that looks like this:

```yaml
output:
  pdf_document:
toc: true

├── output:
│   └── pdf_document: null
└── toc: true

```
Some YAML fields take unnamed vectors as their value. You can specify an element of the vector by adding a new line and - (note that the values can be indented or not below category here).

```yaml
category:
- R
- Reprodicible Research
```

### Quote and R code

You may have noticed that strings in YAML don’t always need to be quoted. However, it can be useful to explicitly wrap strings in quotes when they contain special characters like : and @.

```yaml
title: 'R Markdown: An Introduction'
```

R code can be written as inline expressions `` `r knitr::inline_expr('expr')` ``.  R code in `params` needs to be slightly different: use `!r `(e.g. `!r expr`) to call an R object.


```yaml
author: "`r knitr::inline_expr('whoami::fullname()')` "
params:
  date: !r Sys.Date()
```

## Basic setting metadata

### Top-level basic settings

These settings are based on the original `rmarkdown` package without any other associated packages.

Set Top-level Basic R Markdown YAML Fields. e.g.

```yaml
---
title: "YAML metadata for R Markdown with examples"
subtitle: "YAML header"
author: Hao Liang
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  md_document:
    toc: yes
    toc_depth: 2
abstract: YAML is a human-readable and easy to write language to define data structures.
keywords: ["YAML", "Rmd"]
subject: Medicine
description: Rmd makes it possible to use a YAML header to specify certain parameters right at the beginning of the document.
category: 
 - Rmd
 - Medicine
lang: "en-US" 
---
```

These field is not available in all output formats. Each is available in:

| field       | html_document | pdf_document | word_document | odt_document | powerpoint_presentation |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| subtitle    | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:      |              |                         |
| abstract    | :smiley:      | :smiley:     |               |              |                         |
| keywords    | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:                |
| subject     | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:                |
| description |               |              | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:                |
| category    |               |              | :smiley:      |              | :smiley:                |
| lang        | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:      | :smiley:     | :smiley:                |

	
The document language using IETF language tags such as "en" or "en-US". The [language subtag lookup tool](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/) can help find the appropriate tag.

> Certain R Markdown templates will allow you to specify additional parameters directly within the YAML. For example, the Distill output format allows url, affiliation, and affiliation_url to be specified. After you install the distill package. You can see the corresponding section in this tutorial (still updating).

```yaml
---
title: "Distill for R Markdown"
author:
  - name: "JJ Allaire"
    url: https://github.com/jjallaire
    affiliation: RStudio
    affiliation_url: https://www.rstudio.com
output: distill::distill_article
---
```

### Output

The `output` field of YAML is very important for R Markdown. The `rmarkdown` package contains a lot of output formats for different use.

> Source: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html

```yaml
---
output: html_notebook
---

```

The `rmarkdown` package/ Rmd natively support the following formats:

  - html_notebook
  - html_document
  - pdf_document
  - word_document
  - odt_document
  - rtf_document
  - md_document
  - github_document
  - ioslides_presentation
  - beamer_presentation
  - powerpoint_presentation
  - html_vignette

If you use one output format without additional arguments, the value of output can simply be the name of the function.

```yaml
---
output: html_document
---
```

However, if you’re specifying more than one output type, you must use the nesting syntax. If you don’t want to include additional arguments, use "default" as the function’s value.

```yaml
---
output:
  html_document: default
  pdf_document: default
---
```

### toc

`toc` is the sub-level option of any output formats. You can add a table of contents (TOC) using the `toc` option and specify the depth of headers that it applies to using the `toc_depth` option[@Xie2018]. For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Habits"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
    toc_float: # invalid for other output formats of non-html
      collapsed: false
      smooth_scroll: false
---
```



# Advanced options for html and pdf

R Markdown stands on the shoulders of `knitr` and Pandoc[@Xie2020]. html and pdf are the most common formats outputted by R Markdown, most other formats are also transformed from them. From the figure below, we clearly see the difference for generating html and pdf. `.md` files can be directly converted to html, but md -> pdf is time-consuming and depends on tex(R Markdown documents are converted to PDF by first converting to a TeX file and then calling the LaTeX engine to convert to PDF. ). So the options for these two formats are not always compatible.

## html

html full YAML example: 

```yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    code_folding: hide #choose to hide/show code blocks initially.
    number_sections: true # add section numbering to headers
    theme: united # Bootstrap theme (themes are drawn from the Bootswatch theme library)
    highlight: tango #specifies the syntax highlighting style
    css: styles.css # custom CSS ( set the theme and potentially highlight to null)
    fig_width: 7 # Figure options
    fig_height: 6
    fig_caption: true
    df_print: paged # tables are printed as HTML tables with support for pagination
    self_contained: false # keep dependencies in external files
    keep_md: true # keep a copy of the Markdown file
    includes:
      in_header: header.html # inject CSS and JavaScript code into the <head> tag
      before_body: doc_prefix.html # include a header that shows a banner or logo.
      after_body: doc_suffix.html # include a footer
    template: template.html # custom templates
    md_extensions: -autolink_bare_uris+hard_line_breaks # preface an option with '-' to disable and '+' to enable itpreface an option with - to disable and + to enable it
---
```

## pdf

### pdf full YAML example for output: 

```yaml
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    toc: true
    number_sections: true
    fig_width: 7
    fig_height: 6
    fig_caption: true
    df_print: kable # print.data.frame(default)/kable/tibble
    highlight: tango
    latex_engine: xelatex # try to use xelatex as default
    keep_tex: true
    keep_tex: true
    template: template.tex
    includes:
      in_header: preamble.tex
      before_body: doc-prefix.tex
      after_body: doc-suffix.tex
---
```
### pdf top-level YAML example

Many aspects of the LaTeX template used to create PDF documents can be customized using top-level YAML metadata (note that these options do not appear underneath the output section, but rather appear at the top level along with title, author, and so on)[@Xie2018]. For example:


```yaml
---
output: pdf_document
fontsize: 11pt
geometry: margin=1in
documentclass: ctexart # usually one of the standard classes, article, book, and report
classoption:
 - twocolumn
 - landscape
linestretch: 2 # adjusts line spacing using the setspace package, e.g. 1.25, 1.5
indent: true  # indent paragraphs
papersize: a4 # paper size, e.g. letter, a4
---
```

Consult the Pandoc manual for the [full list](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex) to know more.

### header-includes:

Tex style and package loading can also put in `header-includes`.

```yaml
---
output: pdf_document
header-includes:
 - \usepackage{fancyhdr}
 - \pagestyle{fancy}
 - \usepackage{ctex} #TeX package for  Chinese
 - \fancyhead[L]{MANUSCRIPT AUTHORS}
 - \fancyhead[R]{MANUSCRIPT SHORT TITLE}
 - \usepackage{lineno} # TeX package for line numbers
 - \linenumbers
---
```

To override or extend some CSS for just one document, include for example:

```yaml
---
output: html_document
header-includes: |
  <style>
  blockquote {
    font-style: italic;
  }
  tr.even {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }
  td, th {
    padding: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 0.5em;
  }
  tbody {
    border-bottom: none;
  }
  </style>
---
```

# Bibliographies and citations

> Source: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html

Pandoc can automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles. In order to use this feature, you will need to specify a bibliography file using the bibliography and style metadata field. 

By default, pandoc will use a Chicago author-date format for citations and references.
To use another style, you will need to specify a CSL 1.0 style file in the csl metadata field. A repository of CSL styles can be found at https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles or http://zotero.org/styles. 

For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Sample Document"
output: html_document
bibliography: bibliography.json
csl: biomed-central.csl
---
```

By default, citations are generated by the utility pandoc-citeproc, and it works for all output formats. When the output is LaTeX/PDF, you can also use LaTeX packages (e.g. `natbib` or `biblatex`) to generate citations

```yaml
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    citation_package: natbib
---
```

# Chinese/Japanese support

html natively support Chinese characters. However, Rmd -> pdf is need more options to display Chinese or Japanese...

There are two ways.

1.`includes` and `header.tex`

```yaml
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    includes:
      in_header: header.tex
---
```
header.tex

``` latex
\usepackage{xeCJK}  
\setCJKmainfont{Noto Sans CJK SC}

```

2.header-includes

use `header-includes` for Chinese document.

```yaml
---
output: pdf_document
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{ctex}
---
```


# parameters and arguments

## params

> Source: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/03/using-parameters-in-rmarkdown/

You can include a `params` section in the YAML header at the top and include variables as key-value pairs:

```yaml
---
params:
  hashtag: "#amca19"
  max_n: 18000
  timezone: "US/Eastern"
title: "Twitter Coverage of `r params$hashtag`"
author: "Neil Saunders"
date: "`r Sys.time()`"
output:
  github_document
---
```

Then, wherever you want to include the value for the variable named `hashtag`, simply use `params$hashtag`, as in the title shown here or in later code chunks or inline R code. e.g.

The data number reach  `` `r knitr::inline_expr('params$max_n')` ``

## Pandoc arguments

Some options are passed to Pandoc, such as toc, toc_depth, and number_sections. You should consult the Pandoc documentation when in doubt. R Markdown output format functions often have a pandoc_args argument, which should be a character vector of extra arguments to be passed to Pandoc. If you find any Pandoc features that are not represented by the output format arguments, you may use this ultimate argument. If the argument is document metadata, you can set it with first-level YAML metadata. e.g., 

```yaml
---
output:  
  word_document:
    toc: true
toc-title: "test for document metadata"
---
```
![toc-title example](images/metadata.png)


Or passed it in with the -M command-line flag.


```yaml
---
output:  
  word_document:
    toc: true
    pandoc_args: [
      "-M", "toc-title=test for document metadata"
    ]
---
```

You can also visit [Pandoc document](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables) to see more arguments

# Shared options

If you want to specify a set of default options to be shared by multiple documents within a directory, you can include a file named `_output.yml` within the directory. Note that no YAML delimiters (---) or the enclosing output field are used in this file. For example:

```yaml
html_document:
  self_contained: false
  theme: united
  highlight: textmate
```
# Future work

We will continue to summarize the YAML options of related packages (e.g. distill, rticles, bookdown, rmdformats )
