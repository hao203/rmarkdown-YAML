================

# Introduction

> Source: <https://rstudio.github.io/distill/>

Distill for R Markdown is based on the [Distill web
framework](https://github.com/distillpub/template), which was originally
created for use in the Distill Machine Learning Journal (Carter, Olah,
and Satyanarayan 2016). Distill for R Markdown combines the technical
authoring features of Distill with R Markdown, enabling a fully
reproducible workflow based on literate programming (Knuth 1984).
