# Introduction

> Source: https://rstudio.github.io/distill/

Distill for R Markdown is based on the [Distill web framework](https://github.com/distillpub/template), which was originally created for use in the Distill Machine Learning Journal (Carter, Olah, and Satyanarayan 2016). Distill for R Markdown combines the technical authoring features of Distill with R Markdown, enabling a fully reproducible workflow based on literate programming (Knuth 1984).
